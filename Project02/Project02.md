# Project 02 - Food Web Analysis with Dynamic Memory #
## Introduction ##
In this project, a food web is built from user-specified predator-prey relationships to build a dynamically allocated 
struct array of organisms, which is then used to identify the relationships between the organisms in the food web. Then, 
the user can modify the food web by adding new organisms (species expansion), adding new predator-prey relationships 
(food source supplementation), or removing organisms from the food web (species extinction).  For these operations, the 
array of organisms AND the set of predator-prey relationships must both be rearranged and reallocated to either allow 
space for the new organism or remove all signs of the extinct species. At any stage, the user can choose to view food 
web characteristics, such as identifying the apex predators, the tastiest food source, the producers, the herbivores, 
the omnivores, and the carnivores. This requires a variety of food web analyses, which you will tackle one step at a 
time.
